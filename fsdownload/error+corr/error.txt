第519条: When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.****The relationship is that they had scoops of fertilizer numbered by 0, one, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and they have mass of beans numbered by 0.0, 0.2, 0.4, etcetera. Decimals going by 2's, so the relationship is that both scoops of fertilizer and mass of beans increases, and then decreases all together.||correct
第520条: When less than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the greater the mass of beans harvested. When more than 3 scoops of fertilizer are used, the more fertilizer used, the less the mass of beans harvested.****Too little scoops of fertilizer is too less but if you put too much it will weigh less as well. But if you put in not too much or not less is good.||incorrect
