第431条:Solar water heaters with blue collectors heat up faster than solar water heaters with red collectors.***It tells you that blue heats up faster because it is a darker color than red.||label:correct
第432条:Solar water heaters with blue collectors heat up faster than solar water heaters with red collectors.***That blue absorbs heat faster than the red.||label:correct
第435条:When 2 variables are changed, it is impossible to determine which variable is causing what effect.***Because one is uncovered and one is covered. Also I think because they are now the same color.||label:incorrect
第440条:Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors. The dark green sheeting is the darkest color available so she should use the green sheeting.***Because the darkest color available would transfer from absorbing the heat from the dark green.||label:correct
第441条:The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.***The as the day go on it gets cooler because the sun is going down.||label:incorrect
第442条:The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.***Because the triangles and containers are the same size and color they will both absorb the same amount of heat.||label:correct
第443条:The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.***I think the same because it is the same size, same shape, same color. It is just placed differently in the container which would not have an impact.||label:correct
第444条:The black areas in the 2 collectors (and the collectors themselves) are the same size. The amount of heat absorbed will be the same so the temperature change will also be the same.***They would be the same because they are the exact same size in the same position with the same size of containers.||label:correct

第447条:A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.***A. A, because if you use or put any water in an earth material it will hold the temperature. Because water is a heat sink.||label:incorrect
第448条:A. Dry soil heats more quickly and cools off more quickly than water. The graph shows A heats and cools more quickly than B, so A must be the dry soil.***B. I think dry soil goes down so it bring plants do not grow quickly so it goes down.||label:incorrect
第449条:A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes).

第451条:A. The water in Julie's heater got hotter faster (or had a greater temperature change in 20 minutes). The collector in heater A has the greater surface area so the water in A would get hotter faster than the water in B.***A. Because Julie's had more black flooring. The more black flooring you get the hotter it gets. Julie's side of the chart had the highest temperature. So box A is hers.||label:correct
第453条:In the morning the Sun is in the east so shadows point west. In the afternoon the Sun is in the west so shadows point east.***Because the sun rounded around us that is why it is pointing the opposite direction.||label:incorrect

第457条:Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.***Yes. Black is a hotter color than white.||label:incorrect
第458条:Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.***Yes. Yes, it would because since she put them both in the sun and stuck a thermometer in both then she will know which box will heat up faster, and she will see if her prediction is correct.||label:incorrect
第459条:Yes. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. White reflects more heat (energy) than black. Therefore the black covered box will heat up faster than the white covered box.***Yes. Yes because black absorbs the heat more than white.||label:correct
第461条:C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.***C. Because black absorbs heat and C has more black area so I think it is C.||label:correct
第462条:C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.***C. Because it has the most black disks. Black absorbs heat.||label:correct
第463条:C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.***C. I picked C because A and B only have one or 2 black plastic disks and that does not take as much heat. Also C has more black so it would be hotter because there is more black.||label:correct
第464条:C. Black absorbs more heat (energy) than white. Pan C has the most dark surface area so C would heat up the fastest and have the highest temperature.***C. Pan C held the hottest water because pan C has a lot of black in it and black absorbs heat. Pan A and B have barely any black. There is more water showing and I know that since water is a heat sink it takes longer to heat up.||label:correct
